# DFDG: Federated GNN Learning for Traffic Forcasting. 

# Datasets
1. MetrLA : A traffic forecasting dataset based on Los Angeles
    Metropolitan traffic conditions. The dataset contains traffic
    readings collected from 207 loop detectors on highways in Los Angeles
    County in aggregated 5 minute intervals for 4 months between March 2012
    to June 2012.

    For further details on the version of the sensor network and
    discretization see: `"Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network:
    Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926>`
