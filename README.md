# DFDG: Federated GNN Learning for Traffic Forcasting 
by Muhammad Usman

# Datasets
1. MetrLA : A traffic forecasting dataset based on Los Angeles
    Metropolitan traffic conditions. The dataset contains traffic
    readings collected from 207 loop detectors on highways in Los Angeles
    County in aggregated 5 minute intervals for 4 months between March 2012
    to June 2012.

    For further details on the version of the sensor network and
    discretization see: `"Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network:
    Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926)`
   
2. PEMS-BAY: This traffic dataset is collected by California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans)
    Performance Measurement System (PeMS). It is represented by a network of 325 traffic sensors
    in the Bay Area with 6 months of traffic readings ranging from Jan 1st 2017 to May 31th 2017
    in 5 minute intervals.

    For details see: `"Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network:
    Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926)`_
